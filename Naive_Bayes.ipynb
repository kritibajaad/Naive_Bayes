    "\n",
    "Finally, let's interpret our results and reflect on the Naive Bayes classifier:\n",
    "1. Performance Discussion: Look at the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 you obtained. Are they satisfactory for a spam filter? Did the model perform better at identifying ham vs spam (check precision and recall values for spam)? For example, if precision is high but recall is low, the filter rarely flags ham as spam (good) but misses some spam (not ideal). Share your observations.\n",
    "2. Effect of Stop Words Removal: If you removed stop words in preprocessing, do you think it helped the model? (You could compare with a run without stop word removal to see the difference, if time permits.) Typically, removing stop words might slightly improve or have minimal effect on spam detection, since stop words are common in both ham and spam and don't carry much discriminatory power. Briefly explain your reasoning or findings.\n",
    "3. Limitations of Naive Bayes: Discuss some limitations of the Naive Bayes approach for text classification in this context:\n",
    "Independence assumption: Naive Bayes assumes that words in a message occur independently given the class, which is not strictly true (e.g., phrases or word combinations aren't considered).\n",
    "Misleading evidence: If a ham message contains a very \"spammy\" word or vice versa, Naive Bayes will weigh that word heavily, possibly ignoring context.\n",
    "Data sparsity: If a spam has words never seen before (which we handled with smoothing), the model might still be unsure. Naive Bayes doesn't capture semanticsâ€”two different words are completely unrelated to it (e.g., \"prize\" and \"award\" are treated as distinct features with no relationship).\n",
    "Other limitations: It's a simple model that might not catch more subtle patterns (like character obfuscation in spam \"cl1ck here\", or the overall structure of messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a short discussion (3-5 sentences for each point above) interpreting the metrics and discussing the effect of stop word removal and limitations of Naive Bayes for spam detection.\n",
    "2. Please provide your answer in the markdown cell below (no code needed here, just explanation)."
