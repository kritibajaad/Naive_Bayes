# NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier  

This project is a **Jupyter Notebook implementation** of the **NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm**, a probabilistic machine learning model based on **Bayesâ€™ Theorem** with the assumption of feature independence. NaÃ¯ve Bayes is widely used in tasks such as **text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis** due to its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

## ğŸ”‘ Key Features  
- Implemented directly in a runnable **Jupyter Notebook**.  
- Demonstrates classification using **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** from scratch and/or with scikit-learn.  
- Covers common variants:  
  - Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes (continuous features)  
  - Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes (text counts)  
  - Bernoulli NaÃ¯ve Bayes (binary features).
